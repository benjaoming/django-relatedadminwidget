Installation:

1. Put relatedwidget folder in your project folder.
2. Add "relatedwidget" to settings.INSTALLED_APPS
3. You may want to run your project's ./manage.py collectstatic
4. In your applications' admin.py, let the model admins inherit from RelatedWidgetWrapperBase like in this example:

    from django.contrib import admin
    from relatedwidget import RelatedWidgetWrapperBase

    class MyModelAdmin(RelatedWidgetWrapperBase, admin.ModelAdmin):
        pass
    
    admin.site.register(MyModel, MyModelAdmin)

It also works with TabularInline and StackedInline! Remember the order of inheritence, always put RelatedWidgetWrapperBase first!

User [nasp](http://djangosnippets.org/users/nasp/) did most of the work, I just updated it for Django 1.4 and packed it as an app.
